This will hide that annoying IntelliScreenX icon. All it does is take you to the Settings.app and most of the time we use the settings app a lot. So why have a icon take you to an area you don't want to go to in the settings app? I've also made it possible to uninstall this app without opening Cydia. Yes I said "Without Opening Cydia" no one has made a app when you can uninstall it directly from the app so I made it possible with this app.
